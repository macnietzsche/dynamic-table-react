# Getting Started with Awesome Dynamic Table React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to use
Just pass an array of objects with format ```{[key: string]: string}``` to the **data** prop of the **DynamicTable** component.

### How it works
It takes an array of objects and dynamically generates each table column header and its corresponding data based on the key and value of the object.

### Sorting the rows
By clicking on any table header, rows will switch order (ascending/descending) based on that data column.

## Running the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
